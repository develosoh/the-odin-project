    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I substituted a puffy spicy snack food from Walmart for the bread crumbs and also added powdered cayenne pepper along
    with salt/pepper + chia seeds (good for you, no taste) and 2 eggs to make 4 large burgers. Patties taste very good on
    their own. Also these patties don't tend to burn like they do when I add ketchup/mustard/relish to the mix. So this is
    the way forward for me.</p>
